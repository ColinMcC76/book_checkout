Book_Checkout Stories 

As a Librarian USER, I would like to be able to READ all checked 
out books SO I can know what I have in inventory. 
    What I mean is I would like to be able to look at all books, wether they are checked out, or in house. Look at the status, checkout date, CARDHOLDER who has book potentially. 

As a Librarian USER, I would like the ability  to UPDATE a checkout/renewal date, 
SO I can allow PATRON CARDHOLDERS to recheckout a book.
    What I mean is I want to be able to edit the checkout date of the book so I can extend it is the PATRON wishes.

As a Librarian USER, I would like the ability to ADD and new CARDHOLDER USER to a database, so that I can allow them to checkout a book in the checkout database.
    What I mean is if a new PATRON wants to sign up for a library card, we can take their name, email, and address, so that we can alow them to checkout a book.

As a Librarian USER, I would like the ability to UPDATE a book from the checkout list, SO I can check in or out the book of a PATRON.
    What I mean is when a CARDHOLDER ants to check in or out a book, I want to UPDATE the status of the book as checked in or out.



As a Librarian USER, I would like the ability to READ all users, SO that I can see what books have been checked out by them and when they are due.
    What I mean is I would like to READ a list of all users, with the books currently checked out to them, listed so that I can see how many they have or if they are overdue.
